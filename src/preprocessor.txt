preprocessor is a separate program that runs before the compiler when you compile your program.
Itâ€™s purpose is to process directives.
Directives are specific instructions that start with a # symbol and end with a newline (NOT a semicolon).

There are several different types of directives:
1)Includes
2)Macro defines
3)Conditional compilation
4)Header guards

The preprocessor manipulates text before the compiler gets to it.
